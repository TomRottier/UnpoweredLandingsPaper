# Point Mass model
A point mass acted upon by gravitational and aerodynamic forces. Represents the fundamental physics occurring.

This directory is a [Julia package](Project.toml) but also contains various [scripts](scripts//) using the model to study the dynamics and control during the landing approach. Write-ups appear in the [doc](doc//) folder and address things such as model derivation, dynamics analysis, and discussion on the model.
