= Abstract
Most birds can transition from aerial to terrestrial locomotion in complex environments. However to touchdown at safe speeds is challenging as the low speeds result in poor aerodynamic control authority, especially in unpowered flight, and how birds manage this is not well understood. Through exploration of the dynamics we provide an analytical optimal control strategy which minimises touchdown speed in unconstrained flight and show that zero touchdown speed is physically possible in unpowered flight albeit at a cost of large velocities and displacements. Such strategies are not commonly observed in birds indicating that other factors likely influence their flight behaviour. When constrained to land on the ground, unpowered landings can no longer touchdown with zero speed, thus requiring increases in fore- or hindlimb skeletomuscular mass to dissipate the remaining kinetic energy. This requirement is a physical constraint that likely shaped avian evolution and may have important implications for unpowered theories of flight evolution. Comparing our model with experimental data on perching birds provides new evidence to support a proposal that birds minimise touchdown speed and time spent post-stall. Overall, our results provide a physical basis for understanding landing behaviour and highlight important physical constraints that may have impacted avian evolution.
