== Sensitivity analysis <sec-results-sensitivity>
In this section we assess the sensitivity of the model outcomes to its parameters (#clmax, #cd0, #cdmax) based on the initial speed required to achieve a touchdown speed of 0.1 and 0.4 (@fig-unsteady). We increase #clmax and #cdmax well beyond their steady-state values as a preliminary exploration of how unsteady aerodynamic effects may affect the landing and which are not explicitly captured in our aerodynamics model. The main unsteady aerodynamic effect of interest is dynamic or delayed stall due to the rate of change of angle of attack and which can result in large, transient increases in the lift and drag coefficients @stricklandForceCoefficientsNACA00151987 @granlundUnsteadyPitchingFlat2013 @leishmanPrinciplesHelicopterAerodynamics2017 @kieferDynamicStallHigh2022. Previous work has found that #clmax and #cdmax scale linearly with pitch rate, whilst approximately retaining the trigonometric form of @eq-clcd @stricklandForceCoefficientsNACA00151987 @granlundUnsteadyPitchingFlat2013, supporting the approach taken here. Unsteady effects of phase lag and added mass are neglected @wangUnsteadyForcesFlows2004 @andersenUnsteadyAerodynamicsFluttering2005.

For a small touchdown speed of 0.1, doubling #clmax from its nominal value resulted in a 44% reduction in the initial speed required and a 65% and 55% reduction in the horizontal and vertical displacements, respectively (grey and blue trajectories @fig-unsteady\A). However, doubling #cdmax from its nominal value led to a 31% increase in initial speed and a 68% and 15% increase in the horizontal and vertical displacements (grey and yellow trajectories @fig-unsteady\A). Increasing #cdmax lead to increases in the initial speed because low speeds can only be achieved with steep climb angles. Increasing #cdmax reduces the ability to achieve these steep climbs as it increases the deceleration relative to the increase in flight path angle (see @sec-results-optcontrol) and as such requires a greater initial speed. For larger touchdown speeds of 0.4 this effect was less pronounced and doubling #cdmax decreased the required initial speed (5%) although this was still much less than when doubling #clmax (49%).

The largest initial speeds are capped at the maximum terminal speed ($nu_T^* = sqrt(1\/C_("D"0))$) in @fig-unsteady. This is the fastest speed a bird could travel at without additional energy input (e.g. flapping the wings). As such, regions in the parameter space that require an initial speed greater than $nu_T^*$ would be unable to attain the given touchdown speed - even in unconstrained flight. Such limits could be important in understanding the morphological requirements early in the evolution of flight.

Birds @carruthersAutomaticAeroelasticDevices2007 @poletRapidAreaChange2015 @kleinheerenbrinkOptimizationAvianPerching2022 and other gliding vertebrates @bahlmanGlidePerformanceAerodynamics2013 @khandelwalHowBiomechanicsPath2020 have been observed to rapidly pitch up prior to landing which can result in large increases in their lift and drag coefficients @granlundUnsteadyPitchingFlat2013 @poletUnsteadyDynamicsRapid2015. This analysis shows how such kinematics (and the resulting aerodynamic effects) could be of benefit when landing. Large increases in #clmax reduce the initial speed required to land at a given touchdown speed (@fig-unsteady) and thus would require less energy input, either through flapping the wings to accelerate or diving from higher heights. It also reduces the horizontal and vertical displacements covered during the landing manoeuvre. Together these effects could make unpowered landings more feasible within the environments birds fly.

While unsteady aerodynamic effects will not affect the minimum drag coefficient, #cd0, as it relates mainly to the skin friction drag, we assess the sensitivity of the model to this parameter as well. For a touchdown speed of 0.1, doubling and halving #cd0 from its nominal value (0.03) resulted in a 3% larger and 2% smaller required initial speed, respectively.


// Birds may take advantage of unsteady aerodynamic effects through rapidly pitching their wings @carruthersAutomaticAeroelasticDevices2007 to produce large amounts of lift @granlundUnsteadyPitchingFlat2013 and reduce the horizontal and vertical displacements during the climb (@fig-results-unsteady), making it a more feasible landing strategy. The same effects could be utilised by small aerial vehicles where minimising undershoot from the landing point is desirable @wickenheiserOptimizationPerchingManeuvers2008 @alikhanFlightDynamicsOptimization2013.


// The unconstrained (@sec-results-optcontrol) and perching (@sec-results-perching) simulations were repeated including a linear pre-stall model. The parameters for the pre-stall model were chosen such that the maximum lift and drag coefficients were unchanged, but the maximum $C_L \/ C_D$ ratio was increased five fold. No qualitative changes in the results was observed, but including the pre-stall model led to lower initial speeds required to reach a given touchdown speed and for the perching simulations, less thrust was needed to reach the perch.
