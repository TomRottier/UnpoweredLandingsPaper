  abstract = {How can geckoes walk on the ceiling and basilisk lizards run over water? What are the aerodynamic effects that enable small insects to fly? What are the relative merits of squids' jet-propelled swimming and fishes' tail-powered swimming? Why do horses change gait as they increase speed? What determines our own vertical leap? Recent technical advances have greatly increased researchers' ability to answer these questions with certainty and in detail.  This text provides an up-to-date overview of how animals run, walk, jump, crawl, swim, soar, hover, and fly. Excluding only the tiny creatures that use cilia, it covers all animals that power their movements with muscle--from roundworms to whales, clams to elephants, and gnats to albatrosses. The introduction sets out the general rules governing all modes of animal locomotion and considers the performance criteria--such as speed, endurance, and economy--that have shaped their selection. It introduces energetics and optimality as basic principles. The text then tackles each of the major modes by which animals move on land, in water, and through air. It explains the mechanisms involved and the physical and biological forces shaping those mechanisms, paying particular attention to energy costs.  Focusing on general principles but extensively discussing a wide variety of individual cases, this is a superb synthesis of current knowledge about animal locomotion. It will be enormously useful to advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and a range of professional biologists, physicists, and engineers.},

  abstract = {We investigate the aerodynamics of freely falling plates in a quasi-two-dimensional flow at Reynolds number of \$10\textasciicircum\textbraceleft 3\textbraceright\$, which is typical for a leaf or business card falling in air. We quantify the trajectories experimentally using high-speed digital video at sufficient resolution to determine the instantaneous plate accelerations and thus to deduce the instantaneous fluid forces. We compare the measurements with direct numerical solutions of the two-dimensional Navier--Stokes equation. Using inviscid theory as a guide, we decompose the fluid forces into contributions due to acceleration, translation, and rotation of the plate. For both fluttering and tumbling we find that the fluid circulation is dominated by a rotational term proportional to the angular velocity of the plate, as opposed to the translational velocity for a glider with fixed angle of attack. We find that the torque on a freely falling plate is small, i.e. the torque is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the torque on a glider with fixed angle of attack. Based on these results we revise the existing ODE models of freely falling plates. We get access to different kinds of dynamics by exploring the phase diagram spanned by the Reynolds number, the dimensionless moment of inertia, and the thickness-to-width ratio. In agreement with previous experiments, we find fluttering, tumbling, and apparently chaotic motion. We further investigate the dependence on initial conditions and find brief transients followed by periodic fluttering described by simple harmonics and tumbling with a pronounced period-two structure. Near the cusp-like turning points, the plates elevate, a feature which would be absent if the lift depended on the translational velocity alone.},

  abstract = {Gliding is an efficient form of travel found in every major group of terrestrial vertebrates. Gliding is often modelled in equilibrium, where aerodynamic forces exactly balance body weight resulting in constant velocity. Although the equilibrium model is relevant for long-distance gliding, such as soaring by birds, it may not be realistic for shorter distances between trees. To understand the aerodynamics of inter-tree gliding, we used direct observation and mathematical modelling. We used videography (60--125 fps) to track and reconstruct the three-dimensional trajectories of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) in nature. From their trajectories, we calculated velocities, aerodynamic forces and force coefficients. We determined that flying squirrels do not glide at equilibrium, and instead demonstrate continuously changing velocities, forces and force coefficients, and generate more lift than needed to balance body weight. We compared observed glide performance with mathematical simulations that use constant force coefficients, a characteristic of equilibrium glides. Simulations with varying force coefficients, such as those of live squirrels, demonstrated better whole-glide performance compared with the theoretical equilibrium state. Using results from both the observed glides and the simulation, we describe the mechanics and execution of inter-tree glides, and then discuss how gliding behaviour may relate to the evolution of flapping flight.},

Allometry was used to compare these data with previously published information on the limbs of running birds. In non-runners the digital flexor muscle and tendon areas scaled approximately isometrically, in contrast to running birds where tendon areas had a lower exponent. Non-running birds had muscle fibre areas approximately half that of runners of equal mass. In both groups, the muscle:tendon area ratio for m. gastrocnemius increased as M0.13, suggesting factors other than elastic energy storage are important. Runners exhibited relatively longer tibiotarsi and tarsometatarsi and shorter toes. With very few exceptions, the linear dimensions of bones, tendon cross-sectional areas, and muscle masses and fibre areas in the legs of the non-running birds scaled closely according to the requirements for geometric similarity, but the confidence limits are often wide. Deviations from geometric similarity in birds reflect differences in locomotor behaviours and abilities.},

  abstract = {Summary The agility and manoeuvrability of a flying animal and the inertial power required to flap the wings are related to the moment of inertia of the wings. The moments of inertia of the wings of 29 bird species and three bat species were determined using wing strip analysis. We also measured wing length, wing span, wing area, wing mass and body mass. A strong correlation (r2=0.997) was found between the moment of inertia and the product of wing mass and the square of wing length. Using this relationship, it was found that all birds that use their wings for underwater flight had a higher than average moment of inertia. Assuming sinusoidal wing movement, the inertial power requirement was found to be proportional to (body mass)0.799, an exponent close to literature values for both metabolic power output and minimum power required for flight. Ignoring wing retraction, a fairly approximate estimate showed that the inertial power required is 11--15 \% of the minimum flight power. If the kinetic energy of the wings is partly converted into aerodynamic (useful) work at stroke reversal, the power loss due to inertial effects may be smaller.},

  abstract = {Takeoff and landing are critical phases in a flight. To better understand the functional importance of the kinematic adjustments birds use to execute these flight modes, we studied the wing and body movements of pigeons (Columba livia) during short-distance free-flights between two perches. The greatest accelerations were observed during the second wingbeat of takeoff. The wings were responsible for the majority of acceleration during takeoff and landing, with the legs contributing only one-quarter of the acceleration. Parameters relating to aerodynamic power output such as downstroke amplitude, wingbeat frequency and downstroke velocity were all greatest during takeoff flight and decreased with each successive takeoff wingbeat. This pattern indicates that downstroke velocity must be greater for accelerating flight to increase the amount of air accelerated by the wings. Pigeons used multiple mechanisms to adjust thrust and drag to accelerate during takeoff and decelerate during landing. Body angle, tail angle and wing plane angles all shifted from more horizontal orientations during takeoff to near-vertical orientations during landing, thereby reducing drag during takeoff and increasing drag during landing. The stroke plane was tilted steeply downward throughout takeoff (increasing from -60\textpm 5 deg. to -47\textpm 1 deg.), supporting our hypothesis that a downward-tilted stroke plane pushes more air rearward to accelerate the bird forward. Similarly, the stroke plane tilted upward during landing (increasing from -1\textpm 2 deg. to 17\textpm 7 deg.), implying that an upward-tilted stroke plane pushes more air forward to slow the bird down. Rotations of the stroke plane, wing planes and tail were all strongly correlated with rotation of the body angle, suggesting that pigeons are able to redirect aerodynamic force and shift between flight modes through modulation of body angle alone.},

  abstract = {Birds frequently must land (safely) on moving branches, and seemingly accomplish this with acrobatic precision. To examine how birds target and land on moving supports, we investigated how lovebirds approach and land on a swinging perch, driven at three sinusoidal frequencies. Flight kinematics were recorded, together with landing forces and pitch torque via a perch-mounted sensor. In support of our hypothesis for stable landings, lovebirds timed half their landings (51.3\%) when the perch was approaching either extreme of motion near zero velocity, exhibiting a robust bimodal strategy for landing-phase timing. Horizontal landing forces exceeded vertical forces across all landing conditions, reflecting the shallow flight trajectory (-13.2~deg relative to horizontal) lovebirds adopted to decelerate and land. A uniform body pitch angle (81.9\textpm 0.46~deg mean\textpm s.e.m.) characterized landing across all conditions, with lovebirds using the horizontal perch reaction force to assist in braking when landing. Body pitch after landing was not well correlated and was generally opposite to the initial direction and magnitude of landing pitch torque. Flexion of the bird's hindlimb joints at landing reduced landing torque by aligning the bird's center of mass trajectory more closely to the perch. Landing pitch torque and body pitch rotation increased uniformly in response to increased perch swing frequency. In contrast to landing forces, pitch torque varied irregularly across landing conditions. Our results indicate that lovebirds regulate their approach trajectory and velocity to time the phase of landing to a moving perch, providing insight for designing biologically inspired unmanned aerial vehicles capable of landing on moving targets.},

The mechanism by which animals achieve a constant safety factor varies depending on the size of the animal. Over much of their size range (0.1 to 300 kilograms), larger mammals maintain uniform skeletal stress primarily by having a more upright posture, which decreases mass-specific muscle force by increasing muscle mechanical advantage. At greater sizes, increased skeletal allometry and decreased locomotor performance likely maintain stresses constant. At smaller sizes, skeletal stiffness may be more critical than strength. The decrease in mass-specific muscle force in mammals weighing 0.1 to 300 kilogram indicates that peak muscle stresses are also constant and correlates with a decrease in mass-specific energy cost of locomotion. The consistent pattern of locomotor stresses developed in long bones at different speeds and gaits within a species may have important implications for how bones adaptively remodel to changes in stress.},

  abstract = {Jumping is a common, but demanding, behavior that many animals employ during everyday activity. In contrast to jump-specialists such as anurans and some primates, jumping biomechanics and the factors that influence performance remains little studied for generalized species that lack marked adaptations for jumping. Computational biomechanical modeling approaches offer a way of addressing this in a rigorous, mechanistic fashion. Here, optimal control theory and musculoskeletal modeling are integrated to generate predictive simulations of maximal height jumping in a small ground-dwelling bird, a tinamou. A three-dimensional musculoskeletal model with 36 actuators per leg is used, and direct collocation is employed to formulate a rapidly solvable optimal control problem involving both liftoff and landing phases. The resulting simulation raises the whole-body center of mass to over double its standing height, and key aspects of the simulated behavior qualitatively replicate empirical observations for other jumping birds. However, quantitative performance is lower, with reduced ground forces, jump heights, and muscle--tendon power. A pronounced countermovement maneuver is used during launch. The use of a countermovement is demonstrated to be critical to the achievement of greater jump heights, and this phenomenon may only need to exploit physical principles alone to be successful; amplification of muscle performance may not necessarily be a proximate reason for the use of this maneuver. Increasing muscle strength or contractile velocity above nominal values greatly improves jump performance, and interestingly has the greatest effect on more distal limb extensor muscles (i.e., those of the ankle), suggesting that the distal limb may be a critical link for jumping behavior. These results warrant a re-evaluation of previous inferences of jumping ability in some extinct species with foreshortened distal limb segments, such as dromaeosaurid dinosaurs.Simulations pr\'edictives de la fonction musculo-squelettique et des performances de saut chez un oiseau g\'en\'eralis\'e Sauter est un comportement commun, mais exigeant, que de nombreux animaux utilisent au cours de leurs activit\'es quotidiennes. Contrairement aux sp\'ecialistes du saut tels que les anoures et certains primates, la biom\'ecanique du saut et les facteurs qui influencent la performance restent peu \'etudi\'es pour les esp\`eces g\'en\'eralis\'ees qui n'ont pas d'adaptations marqu\'ees pour le saut. Les approches de mod\'elisation biom\'ecanique computationnelle offrent un moyen d'aborder cette question de mani\`ere rigoureuse et m\'ecaniste. Ici, la th\'eorie du contr\^ole optimal et la mod\'elisation musculo-squelettique sont int\'egr\'ees pour g\'en\'erer des simulations pr\'edictives du saut en hauteur maximal chez un petit oiseau terrestre, le tinamou. Un mod\`ele musculo-squelettique tridimensionnel avec 36 actionneurs par patte est utilis\'e, et une m\'ethode num\'erique nomm\'ee ``direct collocation'' est employ\'ee pour formuler un probl\`eme de contr\^ole optimal rapidement r\'esoluble impliquant les phases de d\'ecollage et d'atterrissage. La simulation qui en r\'esulte \'el\`eve le centre de masse du corps entier \`a plus du double de sa hauteur debout, et les aspects cl\'es du comportement simul\'e reproduisent qualitativement les observations empiriques d'autres oiseaux sauteurs. Cependant, les performances quantitatives sont moindres, avec une r\'eduction des forces au sol, des hauteurs de saut et de la puissance musculo-tendineuse. Une man\oe uvre de contre-mouvement prononc\'ee est utilis\'ee pendant le lancement. Il a \'et\'e d\'emontr\'e que l'utilisation d'un contre-mouvement est essentielle \`a l'obtention de hauteurs de saut plus importantes, et il se peut que ce ph\'enom\`ene doive exploiter uniquement des principes physiques pour r\'eussir; l'amplification de la performance musculaire n'est pas n\'ecessairement une raison imm\'ediate de l'utilisation de cette man\oe uvre. L'augmentation de la force musculaire ou de la vitesse de contraction au-dessus des valeurs nominales am\'eliore grandement la performance de saut et, fait int\'eressant, a le plus grand effet sur les muscles extenseurs des membres plus distaux (c'est-\`a-dire ceux de la cheville), ce qui sugg\`ere que le membre distal peut \^etre un lien critique pour le comportement de saut. Ces r\'esultats justifient une r\'e\'evaluation des d\'eductions pr\'ec\'edentes de la capacit\'e de sauter chez certaines esp\`eces \'eteintes avec des segments de membres distaux raccourcis, comme les dinosaures drom\'eosaurid\'es.Voorspellende simulaties van musculoskeletale functie en springprestaties bij een gegeneraliseerde vogel Springen is een veel voorkomend, maar veeleisend, gedrag dat veel dieren toepassen tijdens hun dagelijkse bezigheden. In tegenstelling tot de springspecialisten zoals de anura en sommige primaten, is de biomechanica van het springen en de factoren die de prestaties be\"invloeden nog weinig bestudeerd voor algemene soorten die geen uitgesproken adaptaties voor het springen hebben. Computationele biomechanische modelbenaderingen bieden een manier om dit op een rigoureuze, mechanistische manier aan te pakken. Hier worden optimale controle theorie en musculoskeletale modellering ge\"integreerd om voorspellende simulaties te genereren van maximale hoogtesprong bij een kleine grondbewonende vogel, een tinamou. Een driedimensionaal musculoskeletaal model met 36 actuatoren per poot wordt gebruikt, en directe collocatie wordt toegepast om een snel oplosbaar optimaal controleprobleem te formuleren dat zowel de opstijg-als de landingsfase omvat. De resulterende simulatie verhoogt het lichaamszwaartepunt tot meer dan het dubbele van de stahoogte, en belangrijke aspecten van het gesimuleerde gedrag komen kwalitatief overeen met empirische waarnemingen voor andere springende vogels. De kwantitatieve prestaties zijn echter minder, met verminderde grondkrachten, spronghoogtes en spierpeeskracht. Tijdens de lancering wordt een uitgesproken tegenbewegingsmanoeuvre gebruikt. Aangetoond is dat het gebruik van een tegenbeweging van cruciaal belang is voor het bereiken van grotere spronghoogten, en dit fenomeen hoeft alleen op fysische principes te berusten om succesvol te zijn; versterking van de spierprestaties hoeft niet noodzakelijk een proximate reden te zijn voor het gebruik van deze manoeuvre. Het verhogen van de spierkracht of van de contractiesnelheid boven de nominale waarden verbetert de sprongprestatie aanzienlijk, en heeft interessant genoeg het grootste effect op de meer distale extensoren van de ledematen (d.w.z. die van de enkel), wat suggereert dat de distale ledematen een kritieke schakel kunnen zijn voor het springgedrag. Deze resultaten rechtvaardigen een herevaluatie van eerdere conclusies over springvermogen bij sommige uitgestorven soorten met voorgekorte distale ledematen, zoals dromaeosauride dinosauri\"ers.Pr\"adiktive Simulationen der muskuloskelettalen Funktion und Sprungleistung bei einem generalisierten Vogel Springen ist ein \"ubliches jedoch anstrengendes Verhalten, das viele Tiere bei ihren t\"aglichen Aktivit\"aten einsetzen.

  abstract = {Gliding has evolved independently at least six times in mammals. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of gliding. These include the evasion of predators, economical locomotion or foraging, control of landing forces, and habitat structure. Here we use a combination of comparative methods and ecological and biomechanical data collected from free-ranging animals to evaluate these hypotheses. Our comparative data suggest that the origins of gliding are often associated with shifts to low-quality diets including leaves and plant exudates. Further, data from free-ranging colugos suggest that although gliding is not more energetically economical than moving through the canopy, it is much faster, allowing shorter times of transit between foraging patches and therefore more time available to forage in a given patch. In addition to moving quickly, gliding mammals spend only a small fraction of their overall time engaged in locomotion, likely offsetting its high cost. Kinetic data for both take-off and landing suggest that selection on these behaviors could also have shaped the evolution of gliding. Glides are initiated by high-velocity leaps that are potentially effective in evading arboreal predators. Further, upon landing, the ability to control aerodynamic forces and reduce velocity prior to impact is likely key to extending distances of leaps or glides while reducing the likelihood of injury. It is unlikely that any one of these hypotheses exclusively explains the evolution of gliding, but by examining gliding in multiple groups of extant animals in ecological and biomechanical contexts, new insights into the evolution of gliding can be gained.},

As the scale of substrate discontinuity increases, many arboreal animals rely on leaping or gliding locomotion between distant supports. In order to successfully move through their habitat, gliding animals must actively modulate both propulsive and aerodynamic forces. Here we examined the take-off and landing kinetics of a free-ranging gliding mammal, the Malayan colugo (Galeopterus variegatus) using a custom-designed three-dimensional accelerometry system. We found that colugos increase the propulsive impulse to affect longer glides. However, we also found that landing forces are negatively associated with glide distance. Landing forces decrease rapidly as glide distance increases from the shortest glides, then level off, suggesting that the ability to reorient the aerodynamic forces prior to landing is an important mechanism to reduce velocity and thus landing forces. This ability to substantially alter the aerodynamic forces acting on the patagial wing in order to reorient the body is a key to the transition between leaping and gliding and allows gliding mammals to travel long distances between trees with reduced risk of injury. Longer glides may increase the access to distributed resources and reduce the exposure to predators in the canopy or on the forest floor.},

Chaotic deflections of the upperwing coverts observed using video cameras carried by the bird (50 frames s--1) indicate trailing-edge separation but attached flow near the leading edge during flapping and gust response, and completely stalled flows upon landing. The underwing coverts deflect automatically along the leading edge at high angle of attack. We use high-speed digital video (500 frames s--1) to analyse these deflections in greater detail during perching sequences indoors and outdoors. Outdoor perching sequences usually follow a stereotyped three-phase sequence comprising a glide, pitch-up manoeuvre and deep stall. During deep stall, the spread-eagled bird has aerodynamics reminiscent of a cross-parachute. Deployment of the underwing coverts is closely phased with wing sweeping during the pitch-up manoeuvre,and is accompanied by alula protraction. Surprisingly, active alula protraction is preceded by passive peeling from its tip. Indoor flights follow a stereotyped flapping perching sequence, with deployment of the underwing coverts closely phased with alula protraction and the end of the downstroke. We propose that the underwing coverts operate as an automatic high-lift device, analogous to a Kruger flap. We suggest that the alula operates as a strake, promoting formation of a leading-edge vortex on the swept hand-wing when the arm-wing is completely stalled, and hypothesise that its active protraction is stimulated by its initial passive deflection. These aeroelastic devices appear to be used for flow control to enhance unsteady manoeuvres, and may also provide sensory feedback.},

  abstract = {The natural world is filled with substrates of varying properties that challenge locomotor abilities. Birds appear to transition smoothly from aerial to terrestrial environments during takeoffs and landings using substrates that are incredibly variable. It may be challenging to control movement on and off compliant (flexible) substrates such as twigs, yet birds routinely accomplish such tasks. Previous research suggests that birds do not use their legs to harness elastic recoil from perches. Given avian mastery of take-off and landing, we hypothesized that birds instead modulate wing, body and tail movements to effectively use compliant perches. We measured take-off and landing performance of diamond doves (Geopelia cuneata (N = 5) in the laboratory and perch selection in this species in the field (N = 25). Contrary to our hypothesis, doves do not control take-off and landing on compliant perches as effectively as they do on stiff perches. They do not recover elastic energy from the perch, and take-off velocities are thus negatively impacted. Landing velocities remain unchanged, which suggests they may not anticipate the need to compensate for compliance. Legs and wings function as independent units: legs produce lower initial velocities when taking off from a compliant substrate, which negatively impacts later flight velocities. During landing, significant stability problems arise with compliance that are ameliorated by the wings and tail. Collectively, we suggest that the diamond dove maintains a generalized take-off and landing behavior regardless of perch compliance, leading us to conclude that perch compliance represents a challenge for flying birds. Free-living diamond doves avoid the negative impacts of compliance by preferentially selecting perches of larger diameter, which tend to be stiffer.},

  abstract = {Accelerations and directional changes of flying animals derive from interactions between aerodynamic force production and the inertial resistance of the body to translation and rotation. Anatomical and allometric features of body design thus mediate the rapidity of aerial maneuvers. Both translational and rotational responsiveness of the body to applied force decrease with increased total mass. For flying vertebrates, contributions of the relatively heavy wings to whole-body rotational inertia are substantial, whereas the relatively light wings of many insect taxa suggest that rotational inertia is dominated by the contributions of body segments. In some circumstances, inertial features of wing design may be as significant as are their aerodynamic properties in influencing the rapidity of body rotations. Stability in flight requires force and moment balances that are usually attained via bilateral symmetry in wingbeat kinematics, whereas body roll and yaw derive from bilaterally asymmetric movements of both axial and appendicular structures. In many flying vertebrates, use of the tail facilitates the generation of aerodynamic torques and substantially enhances quickness of body rotation. Geometrical constraints on wingbeat kinematics may limit total force production and thus accelerational capacity in certain behavioral circumstances. Unitary limits to animal flight performance and maneuverability are unlikely, however, given varied and context-specific interactions among anatomical, biomechanical, and energetic features of design.},

  abstract = {Flight performance seems to change systematically with body size: small animals can hover and fly over a wide range of speeds, but large birds taxi for takeoff and then fly over a narrow speed range. The traditional explanation for this is that the mass-specific power required for flight varies with speed according to a U-shaped curve, and it also scales between m0 and m1/6, where m is body mass. The mass-specific power available from the flight muscles is assumed to scale as m-1/3 As available power decreases with increasing body size, the range of attainable flight speeds becomes progressively reduced until the largest animals can only fly in the trough of the U-shaped curve. Above a particular size, the available power is insufficient and flapping flight is not possible.The underlying assumptions of this argument are examined in this review. Metabolic measurements are more consistent with a J-shaped curve, with little change in power from hovering to intermediate flight speeds, than with a U-shaped curve. Scaling of the mass-specific power required to fly agrees with predictions. The mass-specific power available from, the muscles, estimated from maximal loading studies, varies as m0.13. This scaling cannot be distinguished from that of the power required to fly, refuting the argument that power imposes an intrinsic scaling on flight performance. It is suggested instead that limitations on low-speed performance result from an adverse scaling of lift production with increasing body size},

For higher rates, a leading edge vortex forms; its history also depends on pitch pivot point, but linear shift in time base is not successful in collapsing lift/drag history.

The movement of the wing sweep in flight enables large pitching moments suitable for performing perching manoeuvres. Wind tunnel data is presented that confirms the favourable characteristics expected from sweeping the wing and achieving high pitch rates. Whilst only small sweep changes are required during flight, the design allows up to 30{$\circ$} forward sweep for significant pitching moments during the flare. A new collection of controllers is developed based on observations from similar landing techniques performed by birds and hang-gliders onto flat ground. The three-stage landing process takes the aircraft along an approach path, through a roundout procedure during which airspeed decays and concludes with rapid pitch up. Flight test results are presented during which it is found that the airspeed can be reduced to, on average, under 3~m/s in the final moments before landing -- well below the stall speed of 9~m/s.},

We find that wing morphing allows birds to substantially change their roll and yaw inertia but has a minimal effect on the position of the centre of gravity. With the addition of inertial characteristics, we derived a novel metric of pitch agility and estimated the static pitch stability, revealing that the agility and static margin ranges are reduced as body mass increases.

This in-flight adaptability has inspired many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wings, which predominately morph within a single geometric plane. By contrast, avian joint-driven wing morphing produces a diverse set of non-planar wing shapes. Here, we investigated if joint-driven wing morphing is desirable for UAVs by quantifying the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of gull-inspired wing-body configurations. We used a numerical lifting-line algorithm (MachUpX) to determine the aerodynamic loads across the range of motion of the elbow and wrist, which was validated with wind tunnel tests using three-dimensional printed wing-body models. We found that joint-driven wing morphing effectively controls lift, pitching moment and static margin, but other mechanisms are required to trim. Within the range of wing extension capability, specific paths of joint motion (trajectories) permit distinct longitudinal flight control strategies. We identified two unique trajectories that decoupled stability from lift and pitching moment generation. Further, extension along the trajectory inherent to the musculoskeletal linkage system produced the largest changes to the investigated aerodynamic properties. Collectively, our results show that gull-inspired joint-driven wing morphing allows adaptive longitudinal flight control and could promote multifunctional UAV designs.},

  abstract = {Wings have long been regarded as a hallmark of evolutionary innovation, allowing insects, birds, and bats to radiate into aerial environments. For many groups, our intuitive and colloquial perspective is that wings function for aerial activities, and legs for terrestrial, in a relatively independent manner. However, insects and birds often engage their wings and legs cooperatively. In addition, the degree of autonomy between wings and legs may be constrained by tradeoffs, between allocating resources to wings versus legs during development, or between wing versus leg investment and performance (because legs must be carried as baggage by wings during flight and vice versa). Such tradeoffs would profoundly affect the development and evolution of locomotor strategies, and many related aspects of animal ecology. Here, we provide the first evaluation of wing versus leg investment, performance and relative use, in birds---both across species, and during ontogeny in three precocial species with different ecologies. Our results suggest that tradeoffs between wing and leg modules help shape ontogenetic and evolutionary trajectories, but can be offset by recruiting modules cooperatively. These findings offer a new paradigm for exploring locomotor strategies of flying organisms and their extinct precursors, and thereby elucidating some of the most spectacular diversity in animal history.},

  abstract = {It seems reasonable that quadrupeds should change gait from a walk to a trot to a gallop in such a way as to minimize their energy consumption, as human beings are known1 to change from a walk to a run at a particular speed (2.4 m s-1) below which walking requires less energy than running and above which the opposite is true. Thus by changing gait, human beings keep the energy cost of locomotion to a minimum as their speed increases. One reason this relation holds is that in humans, metabolic rate increases curvilinearly with walking speed1. If metabolism were a curvilinear function of speed within each of the gaits used by quadrupeds, it would support the hypothesis that they also change gait to minimize energetic cost. There is an old controversy about whether metabolic rate increases linearly or curvilinearly in running humans1,2 but all previous reports have suggested that metabolic rate increases linearly with speed in quadrupeds. Extended gaits were an important experimental tool in the study of human gait changes; thus we have trained three small horses (110--170 kg) to walk, trot and gallop on a motorized treadmill, and to extend their gaits on command. We report here that, using measurements of rates of oxygen consumption as an indicator of rates of energy consumption, we have confirmed that the natural gait at any speed indeed entails the smallest possible energy expenditure.},

  abstract = {Gliding animals traverse cluttered aerial environments when performing ecologically relevant behaviours. However, it is unknown how gliders execute collision-free flight over varying distances to reach their intended target. We quantified complete glide trajectories amid obstacles in a naturally behaving population of gliding lizards inhabiting a rainforest reserve. In this cluttered habitat, the lizards used glide paths with fewer obstacles than alternatives of similar distance. Their takeoff direction oriented them away from obstacles in their path and they subsequently made mid-air turns with accelerations of up to 0.5 g to reorient towards the target tree. These manoeuvres agreed well with a vision-based steering model which maximized their bearing angle with the obstacle while minimizing it with the target tree. Nonetheless, negotiating obstacles reduced mid-glide shallowing rates, implying greater loss of altitude. Finally, the lizards initiated a pitch-up landing manoeuvre consistent with a visual trigger model, suggesting that the landing decision was based on the optical size and speed of the target. They subsequently followed a controlled-collision approach towards the target, ending with variable impact speeds. Overall, the visually guided path planning strategy that enabled collision-free gliding required continuous changes in the gliding kinematics such that the lizards never attained theoretically ideal steady-state glide dynamics.},

  abstract = {, The transient pressure field around a moderately thick airfoil is studied as it undergoes ramp-type pitching motions at high Reynolds numbers and low Mach numbers. A unique set of laboratory experiments were performed in a high-pressure wind tunnel to investigate dynamic stall at chord Reynolds numbers in the range of 0.5\texttimes 106{$\leq$}Rec{$\leq$}5.5\texttimes 1060.5\texttimes 106{$\leq$}Rec{$\leq$}5.5\texttimes 1060.5\textbackslash times 10\textasciicircum 6\textbackslash leq Re \_c\textbackslash leq 5.5\textbackslash times 10\textasciicircum 6 in the absence of compressibility effects. In addition to variations of mean angle and amplitude, pitching manoeuvres at reduced frequencies in the range of 0.01{$\leq$}k{$\leq$}0.400.01{$\leq$}k{$\leq$}0.400.01\textbackslash leq k\textbackslash leq 0.40 were studied by means of surface-pressure measurements. Independently of the parameter variations, all test cases exhibit a nearly identical stall behaviour characterized by a gradual trailing-edge stall, in which the dynamic stall vortex forms approximately at mid-chord. The location of the pitching window with respect to the Reynolds-number-dependent static stall angle is found to define the temporal development of the stall process. The time until stall onset is characterized by a power law, where a small excess of the static stall angle results in a drastically prolonged stall delay. The reduced frequency exhibits a decrease in impact on the stall development in the case of angle-limited pitching manoeuvres. Beyond a critical reduced frequency, both load magnitudes and vortex evolution become reduced frequency independent and instead depend on the geometry of the motion and the convective time scale, respectively. Overall, the characteristics of vortex evolution induced by dynamic stall show remarkable similarities to the framework of optimal vortex formation reported in Gharib et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 360, 1998, pp. 121--140). The data from this study are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.34770/b3vq-sw14.},

  abstract = {Perching at speed is among the most demanding flight behaviours that birds perform1,2 and is beyond the capability of most autonomous vehicles. Smaller birds may touch down by hovering3--8, but larger birds typically swoop up to perch1,2---presumably because the adverse scaling of their power margin prohibits hovering9 and because swooping upwards transfers kinetic to potential energy before collision1,2,10. Perching demands precise control of velocity and pose11--14, particularly in larger birds for which scale effects make collisions especially hazardous6,15. However, whereas cruising behaviours such as migration and commuting typically minimize the cost of transport or time of flight16, the optimization of such unsteady flight manoeuvres remains largely unexplored7,17. Here we show that the swooping trajectories of perching Harris' hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) minimize neither time nor energy alone, but rather minimize the distance flown after stalling. By combining motion capture data from 1,576 flights with flight dynamics modelling, we find that the birds' choice of where to transition from powered dive to unpowered climb minimizes the distance over which high lift coefficients are required. Time and energy are therefore invested to provide the control authority needed to glide safely to the perch, rather than being minimized directly as in technical implementations of autonomous perching under nonlinear feedback control12 and deep reinforcement learning18,19. Naive birds learn this behaviour on the fly, so our findings suggest a heuristic principle that could guide reinforcement learning of autonomous perching.},

  abstract = {During downhill running, manoeuvring, negotiation of obstacles and landings from a jump, mechanical energy is dissipated via active lengthening of limb muscles. Tendon compliance provides a `shock-absorber' mechanism that rapidly absorbs mechanical energy and releases it more slowly as the recoil of the tendon does work to stretch muscle fascicles. By lowering the rate of muscular energy dissipation, tendon compliance likely reduces the risk of muscle injury that can result from rapid and forceful muscle lengthening. Here, we examine how muscle--tendon mechanics are modulated in response to changes in demand for energy dissipation. We measured lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscle activity, force and fascicle length, as well as leg joint kinematics and ground-reaction force, as turkeys performed drop-landings from three heights (0.5--1.5 m centre-of-mass elevation). Negative work by the LG muscle--tendon unit during landing increased with drop height, mainly owing to greater muscle recruitment and force as drop height increased. Although muscle strain did not increase with landing height, ankle flexion increased owing to increased tendon strain at higher muscle forces. Measurements of the length--tension relationship of the muscle indicated that the muscle reached peak force at shorter and likely safer operating lengths as drop height increased. Our results indicate that tendon compliance is important to the modulation of energy dissipation by active muscle with changes in demand and may provide a mechanism for rapid adjustment of function during deceleration tasks of unpredictable intensity.},

  abstract = {When birds are attacked by predators, take-off ability is crucial for the chance of survival. Recently, theoretical studies have predicted that predation risk in terms of reduced flight performance increases with body mass. However, empirical data are scarce. Because migratory birds sometimes double their body mass, mass dependent predation risk may be especially important during migratory fattening. Here we present the first study of take-off ability in relation to migratory fat load. Alarmed take-off flights of caged blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) induced by a simulated predator attack were analysed in terms of velocity and angle of ascent. Fat loads (percentage of fat-free body mass) of the birds ranged from 1\% to 59\%. An increase in fat load was found to influence both velocity and angle of ascent. From our results we calculated that blackcaps carrying 60\% fat loads would have 32\% lower angle of ascent and 17\% lower velocity than blackcaps carrying no fat load. Even though the effect of fat load on the blackcaps was less than indicated in previous experimental studies of other species, our results suggest that the large fat loads needed for migration probably place them at increased risk of predation.}

It is assumed to function similarly to a leading-edge slat that increases lift and delays stall. However, in spite of its universal presence in flying birds and the wide acceptance of stall delay as its main function, how the alula delays the stall and aids the flight of birds remains unclear. Here, we investigated the function of alula on the aerodynamic performance of avian wings based on data from flight tasks and wind-tunnel experiments. With the alula, the birds performed steeper descending flights with greater changes in body orientation. Force measurements revealed that the alula increases the lift and often delays the stall. Digital particle image velocimetry showed that these effects are caused by the streamwise vortex, formed at the tip of the alula, that induces strong downwash and suppresses the flow separation over the wing surface. This is the first experimental evidence that the alula functions as a vortex generator that increases the lift force and enhances manoeuvrability in flights at high angles of attack.},

  abstract = {The diversity of wing morphologies in birds reflects their variety of flight styles and the associated aerodynamic and inertial requirements. Although the aerodynamics underlying wing morphology can be informed by aeronautical research, important differences exist between planes and birds. In particular, birds operate at lower, transitional Reynolds numbers than do most aircraft. To date, few quantitative studies have investigated the aerodynamic performance of avian wings as fixed lifting surfaces and none have focused upon the differences between wings from different flight style groups. Dried wings from 10 bird species representing three distinct flight style groups were mounted on a force/torque sensor within a wind tunnel in order to test the hypothesis that wing morphologies associated with different flight styles exhibit different aerodynamic properties. Morphological differences manifested primarily as differences in drag rather than lift. Maximum lift coefficients did not differ between groups, whereas minimum drag coefficients were lowest in undulating flyers (Corvids). The lift to drag ratios were lower than in conventional aerofoils and data from free-flying soaring species; particularly in high frequency, flapping flyers (Anseriformes), which do not rely heavily on glide performance. The results illustrate important aerodynamic differences between the wings of different flight style groups that cannot be explained solely by simple wing-shape measures. Taken at face value, the results also suggest that wing-shape is linked principally to changes in aerodynamic drag, but, of course, it is aerodynamics during flapping and not gliding that is likely to be the primary driver.},

Rapid neural computation of distance to perch and of speed and deceleration would seem to be required. However, according to the theory, none of this is necessary. Simpler control is possible based solely on the value of the tau function of certain optic variables x, where the tau function of x is x divided by its rate of change; i.e.  is a first-order approximation of time to contact with the perch and so could be used for timing foot extension. Controlled braking is possible by simply keeping , the rate of change of {$\tau$}(x), constant. The results indicated that pigeons did regulate their braking when approaching the perch by keeping  constant and initiated foot extension when {$\tau$}(x) reached a threshold value of approximately 150ms. They followed this procedure even when they had one eye covered, and so binocular vision was not necessary for regulating braking or timing foot extension. It is shown that an optic variable that the pigeons could be using is the width of the optic projection of the gap between foot and perch. It is further shown that they could be using the same optic variable for controlling the trajectory of their feet to contact the perch.},

We investigate this transformation from `plain paper' to `paper plane' through experiments, aerodynamic modelling and free flight simulations of thin plates with differing centre of mass (CoM) locations. Periodic modes such as fluttering, tumbling and bounding give way to steady gliding and then downward diving as the CoM is increasingly displaced towards one edge. To explain these observations, we formulate a quasi-steady aerodynamic model whose force and torque coefficients are informed by experimental measurements. The dependencies on angle of attack reflect the transition from attached to separated flow and a dynamic centre of pressure, effects that prove critical to reproducing the observed motions of paper planes in air and plates in water. Because the model successfully accounts for unsteady and steady flight modes, it may be usefully applied to further problems involving actuated motions, feedback control and interactions with ambient flows.},

  abstract = {, Researchers have hypothesized that the post-stall lift benefit of bird's alular feathers, or alula, stems from the maintenance of an attached leading-edge vortex (LEV) over their thin-profiled, outer hand wing. Here, we investigate the connection between the alula and LEV attachment via flow measurements in a wind tunnel. We show that a model alula, whose wetted area is 1~\% that of the wing, stabilizes a recirculatory aft-tilted LEV on a steadily translating unswept wing at post-stall angles of attack. The attached vortex is the result of the alula's ability to smoothly merge otherwise separate leading- and side-edge vortical flows. We identify two key processes that facilitate this merging: (i) the steering of spanwise vorticity generated at the wing's leading edge back to the wing plane and (ii) an aft-located wall jet of high-magnitude root-to-tip spanwise flow ({$>$}80\%{$>$}80\%\textbraceleft{$>$}\textbraceright 80\textbackslash,\textbackslash\% that of the free-stream velocity). The former feature induces LEV roll-up while the latter tilts LEV vorticity aft and evacuates this flow toward the wing tip via an outboard vorticity flux. We identify the alula's streamwise position (relative to the leading edge of the thin wing) as important for vortex steering and the alula's cant angle as important for high-magnitude spanwise flow generation. These findings advance our understanding of the likely ways birds leverage LEVs to augment slow flight.},

  abstract = {Maximum lift production during takeoff in still air was determined for a wide variety of insects and a small sample of birds and bats, and was compared with variation in morphology, taxonomy and wingbeat type. Maximum lift per unit flight muscle mass was remarkably similar between taxonomic groups (54--63 N kg-1), except for animals using clap-and-fling wingbeats, where muscle mass-specific lift increased by about 25 \% (72--86 N kg-1). Muscle mass-specific lift was independent of body mass, wing loading, disk loading and aspect ratio. Birds and bats yielded results indistinguishable from insects using conventional wingbeats. Interspecific differences in short-duration powered flight and takeoff ability are shown to be caused primarily by differences in flight muscle ratio, which ranges from 0{$\cdot$}115 to 0{$\cdot$}560 among species studied to date. These results contradict theoretical predictions that maximum mass-specific power output and lift production should decrease with increasing body mass and wing disk loading.},

  abstract = {Birds routinely execute post-stall maneuvers with a speed and precision far beyond the capabilities of our best aircraft control systems. One remarkable example is a bird exploiting post-stall pressure drag in order to rapidly decelerate to land on a perch. Stall is typically associated with a loss of control authority, and it is tempting to attribute this agility of birds to the intricate morphology of the wings and tail, to their precision sensing apparatus, or their ability to perform thrust vectoring. Here we ask whether an extremely simple fixed-wing glider (no propeller) with only a single actuator in the tail is capable of landing precisely on a perch from a large range of initial conditions. To answer this question, we focus on the design of the flight control system; building upon previous work which used linear feedback control design based on quadratic regulators (LQR), we develop nonlinear feedback control based on nonlinear model-predictive control and `LQR-Trees'. Through simulation using a flat-plate model of the glider, we find that both nonlinear methods are capable of achieving an accurate bird-like perching maneuver from a large range of initial conditions; the `LQR-Trees' algorithm is particularly useful due to its low computational burden at runtime and its inherent performance guarantees. With this in mind, we then implement the `LQR-Trees' algorithm on real hardware and demonstrate a 95 percent perching success rate over 147 flights for a wide range of initial speeds. These results suggest that, at least in the absence of significant disturbances like wind gusts, complex wing morphology and sensing are not strictly required to achieve accurate and robust perching even in the post-stall flow regime.},

  abstract = {The presence of a stable leading edge vortex (LEV) on steadily revolving wings increases the maximum lift coefficient that can be generated from the wing and its role is important to understanding natural flyers and flapping wing vehicles. In this paper, the role of LEV in lift augmentation is discussed under two hypotheses referred to as `additional lift' and `absence of stall'. The `additional lift' hypothesis represents the traditional view. It presumes that an additional suction/circulation from the LEV increases the lift above that of a potential flow solution. This behaviour may be represented through either the `Polhamus leading edge suction' model or the so-called `trapped vortex' model. The `absence of stall' hypothesis is a more recent contender that presumes that the LEV prevents stall at high angles of attack where flow separation would normally occur. This behaviour is represented through the so-called `normal force' model. We show that all three models can be written in the form of the same potential flow kernel with modifiers to account for the presence of a LEV. The modelling is built on previous work on quasi-steady models for hovering wings such that model parameters are determined from first principles, which allows a fair comparison between the models themselves, and the models and experimental data. We show that the two models which directly include the LEV as a lift generating component are built on a physical picture that does not represent the available experimental data. The simpler `normal force' model, which does not explicitly model the LEV, performs best against data in the literature. We conclude that under steady conditions the LEV as an `absence of stall' model/mechanism is the most satisfying explanation for observed aerodynamic behaviour.},

  abstract = {I counter recent criticism against the arboreal theory of the evolution of flight in vertebrates. It has been stated, for instance, that incipient flapping during gliding would dramatically reduce lift, and that the generation of vortex rings by wing strokes must be a principal problem for animals to solve in evolving powered flight. The criticism is mostly unfounded and lacks adequate explanations. My model, based on quasi-stationary aerodynamics, shows that sufficient lift and a net thrust can be produced even during very slight flapping in a gliding animal. The model is constructed so that the various flight variables always combine in such a way that the vertical lift force produced during one complete wing stroke in partially powered flight by a hypothetical animal always equals the weight of the animal. Given this constraint, the model then explores whether there is any net horizontal thrust beyond that needed to balance body drag. The outcome is that, given certain flight variables, a net thrust will always be generated during partially powered flight. Any such thrust can be used to make the flight path shallower than it is in equilibrium gliding for the same animal. This strongly supports the arboreal theory of the evolution of flight in birds, bats, and pterosaurs, which includes a gliding stage before powered flight originated. The transition between gliding and flapping also can be easily explained by the vortex theory. As it travels, a gliding animal leaves a continuous vortex sheet which rolls up into a pair of vortex tubes. Slight flapping might create undulating vortex tubes of essentially the same character. During more powerful flapping and with the upstroke being a recovery stroke, or with the air meeting the dorsal side of the wings on the upstroke, providing thrust and negative lift, the vortex tubes become interrupted and roll up into vortex rings. My aerodynamic model applies to the transition from gliding to powered flight, regardless of the evolutionary path of the gliding behavior.},

  abstract = {A theory is presented for calculating the relation between mechanical power required to fly and forward speed, for a bird flying horizontally. The significance of this for migration is explained, and quick methods are given (and summarized in the Appendix) for calculating key points on the curve. Speed ranges and effective lift: drag ratios are calculated for a number of different flying animals. Factors affecting migration range are discussed, and the effects of head- and tailwinds are considered. Still-air range depends on effective lift: drag ratio, but not on size or weight as such. The relation of power required to that available from the muscles is considered. Small birds have a greater margin of power available over power required than large ones, and tend to run their flight muscles at a lower stress, or lower specific shortening, or both. There is an upper limit to the mass of practicable flying birds, represented approximately by the Kori Bustard Ardeotit kori. The effect of adding extra weight (food or fuel) is to increase both minimum-power speed, and maximum-range speed, in proportion to the square root of the weight, and to increase the corresponding powers in proportion to the three-halves power of the weight. Birds up to about 750 g (fat-free) can double their fat-free mass, and still have sufficient power to fly at the maximum-range speed. Larger birds are progressively more severely limited in the maximum loads they can carry, and this reduces their range. Many large birds migrate by thermal soaring, thus economizing on fuel at the expense of making slower progress. During a long flight both speed and power have to be progressively reduced as fuel is used up. A formula is given for calculating the still-air range of a bird which does this in an optimal fashion. The only data required are the effective lift: drag ratio, and the proportion of the take-off mass devoted to fuel. Increase of height has no effect on the still-air range, but the optimum cruising speed (and power) is increased. The optimum cruising height is reached when the bird can absorb oxygen just fast enough to maintain the required power. The optimum height increases progressively as fuel is used up. No range is lost as a result of the work done in climbing to the cruising height.},

The minimum power speed is 8 -- 9 m./sec. The maximum continuous power output is estimated to be 10{$\cdot$}5 W., and the corresponding oxygen consumption about 170 ml./min. The maximum (sprint) power is estimated to be 20{$\cdot$}4 W., from observations of vertical climb after take-off.The estimated best lift: drag ratio in horizontal flight is 5{$\cdot$}9, giving a range of 11{$\cdot$}8 km./g. of fat oxidized for a 400 g. pigeon.It is argued from considerations of structural strength that the early part of the downstroke is used mainly to impart angular velocity to the wing, and that air loads are only developed after most of the angular acceleration has taken place. The tension in the pectoralis insertion may exceed 60\% of the breaking tension in fast horizontal flight.The power calculation was repeated for the ruby-throated hummingbird, using published data. Estimated best range is about 900 km./g. of fat oxidized, achieved at 9 m./sec. The corresponding effective lift: drag ratio is 4 {$\cdot$}1.The variation of power required and power available with size is considered, and the effect on hovering and take-off performance of different birds deduced.Performance estimates for the pigeon and ruby-throated hummingbird are very poor by engineering standards, but consistent with these birds' known abilities, and are in general agreement with estimates of effective lift: drag ratio derived from published data on other species.},

We measure pitch rates in a small, wild bird (the black-capped chickadee; Poecile atricapillus), and show that these rates are within the parameter range used in experiments. Pitching rates were characterized by the shape change number, a metric comparing the rate of frontal area increase to acceleration. Blackcapped chickadees increase the shape change number during perching in direct proportion to their total kinetic and potential energy at the start of the manoeuvre. The linear relationship between dissipated energy and shape change number is in accordance with a simple analytical model developed for two-dimensional pitching and decelerating airfoils. Black-capped chickadees use a wing pitch-up manoeuvre during perching to dissipate energy quickly while maintaining lift and drag through rapid area change. It is suggested that similar pitch-and-decelerate manoeuvres could be used to aid in the controlled, precise landings of small manoeuvrable air vehicles.},

In this work we perform a study on a simultaneously decelerating and pitching aerofoil section to increase our understanding of the unsteady aerodynamics of perching. We first explore the problem analytically, developing expressions for the added-mass and circulatory forces arising from boundary-layer separation on a flat-plate aerofoil. Next, we study the model problem through a detailed series of experiments at Re=22000Re=22000\textbackslash mathit\textbraceleft Re\textbraceright =22\textbackslash,000 and two-dimensional simulations at Re=2000Re=2000\textbackslash mathit\textbraceleft Re\textbraceright =2000. Simulated vorticity fields agree with particle image velocimetry measurements, showing the same wake features and vorticity magnitudes. Peak lift and drag forces during rapid perching are measured to be more than 10 times the quasi-steady values. The majority of these forces can be attributed to added-mass energy transfer between the fluid and aerofoil, and to energy lost to the fluid by flow separation at the leading and trailing edges. Thus, despite the large angles of attack and decreasing flow velocity, this simple pitch-up manoeuvre provides a means through which a perching bird can maintain high lift and drag simultaneously while slowing to a controlled stop.},

Recent research has revealed that initial take-off velocity in birds is driven mostly by hindlimb forces. However, the contribution of the wings during the transition to air is unknown. To investigate this transition, we integrated measurements of both leg and wing forces during take-off and the first three wingbeats in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata, body mass 15 g, N=7) and diamond dove (Geopelia cuneata, body mass 50 g, N=3). We measured ground reaction forces produced by the hindlimbs using a perch mounted on a force plate, whole-body and wing kinematics using high-speed video, and aerodynamic forces using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Take-off performance was generally similar between species. When birds were perched, an acceleration peak produced by the legs contributed to 85\textpm 1\% of the whole-body resultant acceleration in finch and 77\textpm 6\% in dove. At lift-off, coincident with the start of the first downstroke, the percentage of hindlimb contribution to initial flight velocity was 93.6\textpm 0.6\% in finch and 95.2\textpm 0.4\% in dove. In finch, the first wingbeat produced 57.9\textpm 3.4\% of the lift created during subsequent wingbeats compared with 62.5\textpm 2.2\% in dove. Advance ratios were \&lt;0.5 in both species, even when taking self-convection of shed vortices into account, so it was likely that wing--wake interactions dominated aerodynamics during wingbeats 2 and 3. These results underscore the relatively low contribution of the wings to initial take-off, and reveal a novel transitional role for the first wingbeat in terms of force production.},

  abstract = {Transitions to and from the air are critical for aerial locomotion and likely shaped the evolution of flying animals. Research on take-off demonstrates that legs generate greater body accelerations compared with wings, and thereby contribute more to initial flight velocity. Here, we explored coordination between wings and legs in two species with different wingbeat styles, and quantified force production of these modules during the final phase of landing. We used the same birds that we had previously studied during take-off: zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata, N=4) and diamond dove (Geopelia cuneata, N=3). We measured kinematics using high-speed video, aerodynamics using particle image velocimetry, and ground-reaction forces using a perch mounted on a force plate. In contrast with the first three wingbeats of take-off, the final four wingbeats during landing featured \textasciitilde 2 times greater force production. Thus, wings contribute proportionally more to changes in velocity during the last phase of landing compared with the initial phase of take-off. The two species touched down at the same velocity (\textasciitilde 1 m s-1), but they exhibited significant differences in the timing of their final wingbeat relative to touchdown. The ratio of average wing force to peak leg force was greater in diamond doves than in zebra finches. Peak ground reaction forces during landing were \textasciitilde 50\% of those during take-off, consistent with the birds being motivated to control landing. Likewise, estimations of mechanical energy flux for both species indicate that wings produce 3--10 times more mechanical work within the final wingbeats of flight compared with the kinetic energy of the body absorbed by legs during ground contact.},

  abstract = {An inverse dynamics multi-segment model of the body was combined with optimisation techniques to simulate normal walking in the sagittal plane on level ground. Walking is formulated as an optimal motor task subject to multiple constraints with minimisation of mechanical energy expenditure over a complete gait cycle being the performance criterion. All segmental motions and ground reactions were predicted from only three simple gait descriptors (inputs): walking velocity, cycle period and double stance duration. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with gait measurements show that the model reproduced the significant characteristics of normal gait in the sagittal plane. The simulation results suggest that minimising energy expenditure is a primary control objective in normal walking. However, there is also some evidence for the existence of multiple concurrent performance objectives.},

Furthermore, these problems involve unusual constraints and dynamics. In order to provide a clearer understanding of the problems involved, the much simpler but related problem of causing a baton to "jump" maximally has been completely solved via elementary methods. The solution is given in feedback form. The state space divides into several regions according to the form of the optimal control. There exist regions where many controls are globally optimal, regions where a locally optimal control and a globally optimal control both exist, and regions where a unique globally optimal control exists. Finally, some relations between these results and experimental observations in both human and animal jumping are discussed.},

One way to extend mission times is to perch, as biological flyers do. Beyond perching, small robot flyers benefit from manoeuvring on surfaces for a diverse set of tasks, including exploration, inspection and collection of samples. These opportunities have prompted an interest in bimodal aerial and surface locomotion on both engineered and natural surfaces. To accomplish such novel robot behaviours, recent efforts have included advancing our understanding of the aerodynamics of surface approach and take-off, the contact dynamics of perching and attachment and making surface locomotion more efficient and robust. While current aerial robots show promise, flying animals, including insects, bats and birds, far surpass them in versatility, reliability and robustness. The maximal size of both perching animals and robots is limited by scaling laws for both adhesion and claw-based surface attachment. Biomechanists can use the current variety of specialized robots as inspiration for probing unknown aspects of bimodal animal locomotion. Similarly, the pitch-up landing manoeuvres and surface attachment techniques of animals can offer an evolutionary design guide for developing robots that perch on more diverse and complex surfaces.},

  abstract = {Most birds can navigate seamlessly between aerial and terrestrial environments. Whereas the forelimbs evolved into wings primarily for flight, the hindlimbs serve diverse functions such as walking, hopping and leaping, and jumping take-off for transitions into flight1. These capabilities have inspired engineers to aim for similar multimodality in aerial robots, expanding their range of applications across diverse environments. However, challenges remain in reproducing multimodal locomotion, across gaits with distinct kinematics and propulsive characteristics, such as walking and jumping, while preserving lightweight mass for flight. This trade-off between mechanical complexity and versatility2 limits most existing aerial robots to only one additional locomotor mode3--5. Here we overcome the complexity--versatility trade-off with RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for multiple ENvironments), which uses its bird-inspired multifunctional legs to jump rapidly into flight, walk on the ground, and hop over obstacles and gaps similar to the multimodal locomotion of birds. We show that jumping for take-off contributes substantially to the initial flight take-off speed6--9 and, remarkably, that it is more energy efficient than taking off without the jump. Our analysis suggests an important trade-off in mass distribution between legs and body among birds adapted for different locomotor strategies, with greater investment in leg mass among terrestrial birds with multimodal gait demands. Multifunctional robot legs expand the opportunities to deploy traditional fixed-wing aircraft in complex terrains through autonomous take-offs and multimodal gaits.},

Helicopter momentum stream tube theory has been adapted for the estimation of the upper size limits for flying animals in gliding, hovering, solitary and formation flight, and also of performance quantities such as minimum, cruising and maximum steady airspeeds, manoeuvrability and the energy cost of transport. The stream tube theory can be criticised as an over-simplification of the complex flow fields of flapping-wing flight, but overall agreement with known animal flight characteristics is found to be generally good. The theory suggests that many flight performance quantities depend mainly on only two parameters: the animal mass and wing span. This allows the design of a two-dimensional chart in which each flying animal has a location, and in which contours of size limits and performance quantities may be cross-plotted. Flight simulation, based on the momentum theory, has been used to explore the take-off flight of hypothetical proto-flyers from ground and from perches. The results favour the ``trees down'' rather than ``ground up'' theory of vertebrate flight origins.},

In flapping flight, very high angles of attack and partly separated flow are common features. Therefore, it is expected that airfoil design parameters affect flapping wing aerodynamics differently.

These species vary in body mass from 0.2 to 5.3 kg, and they use flight almost solely to escape predators. During take-off, all the species used a similar wingbeat style that appeared to be a vortex-ring gait with a tip reversal during the upstroke. The tip reversal is unusual for birds with rounded wings; it may offer an aerodynamic advantage during rapid acceleration. Flight anatomy generally scaled geometrically, except for average wing chord and wing area, which increased more than expected as body mass (m) increased. Pectoralis strain varied from 19.1 to 35.2 \% and scaled in proportion to m0.23. This positive scaling is not consistent with the widely held assumption that muscle strain is independent of body mass among geometrically similar species. The anatomy of the species precluded measurements of in vivo pectoralis force using the strain-gauge technique that has been employed successfully in other bird species, so we could not directly test in vivo pectoralis force--velocity relationships. However, whole-body kinematics revealed that take-off power (Pta), the excess power available for climbing and accelerating in flight, scaled in proportion to m0.75 and that pectoralis mass-specific Pta decreased in proportion to m-0.26 and was directly proportional to wingbeat frequency. These trends suggest that mass-specific pectoralis work did not vary with body mass and that pectoralis stress and strain were inversely proportional, as expected from classical force--velocity models for skeletal muscle. Our observations of Pta were consistent with evidence from other species engaged in escape flight and, therefore, appear to contradict evidence from studies of take-off or hovering with an added payload.},

  abstract = {Competing hypotheses about evolutionary origins of flight are the `fundamental wing-stroke' and `directed aerial descent' hypotheses. Support for the fundamental wing-stroke hypothesis is that extant birds use flapping of their wings to climb even before they are able to fly; there are no reported examples of incrementally increasing use of wing movements in gliding transitioning to flapping. An open question is whether locomotor styles must evolve initially for efficiency or if they might instead arrive due to efficacy. The proximal muscles of the avian wing output work and power for flight, and new research is exploring functions of the distal muscles in relation to dynamic changes in wing shape. It will be useful to test the relative contributions of the muscles of the forearm compared with inertial and aerodynamic loading of the wing upon dynamic morphing. Body size has dramatic effects upon flight performance. New research has revealed that mass-specific muscle power declines with increasing body mass among species. This explains the constraints associated with being large. Hummingbirds are the only species that can sustain hovering. Their ability to generate force, work and power appears to be limited by time for activation and deactivation within their wingbeats of high frequency. Most small birds use flap-bounding flight, and this flight style may offer an energetic advantage over continuous flapping during fast flight or during flight into a headwind. The use of flap-bounding during slow flight remains enigmatic. Flap-bounding birds do not appear to be constrained to use their primary flight muscles in a fixed manner. To improve understanding of the functional significance of flap-bounding, the energetic costs and the relative use of alternative styles by a given species in nature merit study.

Two methods were adopted: direct measurement of the reaction vertical force and torque via a forceplate, and a map of the pressures along and across the wing measured with differential pressure sensors. Wings were tested at Reynolds numbers up to 108,000, typical for slow-flying pigeons, and considerably above previous similar measurements applied to insect and hummingbird wing and wing models. The pigeon wing out-performed the flat card replica, reaching lift coefficients of 1.64 compared with 1.44. Both real and model wings achieved much higher maximum lift coefficients, and at much higher geometric angles of attack (43{$^\circ$}), than would be expected from wings tested in a windtunnel simulating translating flight. It therefore appears that some high-lift mechanisms, possibly analogous to those of slow-flying insects, may be available for birds flapping with wings at high angles of attack. The net magnitude and orientation of aerodynamic forces acting on a revolving pigeon wing can be determined from the differential pressure maps with a moderate degree of precision. With increasing angle of attack, variability in the pressure signals suddenly increases at an angle of attack between 33{$^\circ$} and 38{$^\circ$}, close to the angle of highest vertical force coefficient or lift coefficient; stall appears to be delayed compared with measurements from wings in windtunnels.},

  abstract = {Many functions have been postulated for the aerodynamic role of the avian tail during steady-state flight. By analogy with conventional aircraft, the tail might provide passive pitch stability if it produced very low or negative lift. Alternatively, aeronautical principles might suggest strategies that allow the tail to reduce inviscid, induced drag: if the wings and tail act in different horizontal planes, they might benefit from biplane-like aerodynamics; if they act in the same plane, lift from the tail might compensate for lift lost over the fuselage (body), reducing induced drag with a more even downwash profile. However, textbook aeronautical principles should be applied with caution because birds have highly capable sensing and active control, presumably reducing the demand for passive aerodynamic stability, and, because of their small size and low flight speeds, operate at Reynolds numbers two orders of magnitude below those of light aircraft. Here, by tracking up to 20,000, 0.3\>mm neutrally buoyant soap bubbles behind a gliding barn owl, tawny owl and goshawk, we found that downwash velocity due to the body/tail consistently exceeds that due to the wings. The downwash measured behind the centreline is quantitatively consistent with an alternative hypothesis: that of constant lift production per planform area, a requirement for minimizing viscous, profile drag. Gliding raptors use lift distributions that compromise both inviscid induced drag minimization and static pitch stability, instead adopting a strategy that reduces the viscous drag, which is of proportionately greater importance to lower Reynolds number fliers.},

  abstract = {We compare computational, experimental and quasi-steady forces in a generic hovering wing undergoing sinusoidal motion along a horizontal stroke plane. In particular, we investigate unsteady effects and compare two-dimensional (2D)computations and three-dimensional (3D) experiments in several qualitatively different kinematic patterns. In all cases, the computed drag compares well with the experiments. The computed lift agrees in the cases in which the sinusoidal changes in angle of attack are symmetrical or advanced with respect to stroke positions, but lags behind the measured 3D lift in the delayed case.In the range of amplitudes studied here, 3--5 chords, the force coefficients have a weak dependence on stroke amplitude. As expected, the forces are sensitive to the phase between stroke angle and angle of attack, a result that can be explained by the orientation of the wing at reversal. This dependence on amplitude and phase suggests a simple maneuver strategy that could be used by a flapping wing device.In all cases the unsteady forces quickly reach an almost periodic state with continuous flapping. The fluid forces are dominated by the pressure contribution. The force component directly proportional to the linear acceleration is smaller by a factor proportional to the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude; its net contribution is zero in hovering. The ratio of wing inertia and fluid force is proportional to the product of the ratio of wing and fluid density and the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude; it is negligible in the robotic wing experiment, but need not be in insect flight.To identify unsteady effects associated with wing acceleration, and coupling between rotation and translation, as well as wake capture, we examine the difference between the unsteady forces and the estimates based on translational velocities, and compare them against the estimate of the coupling between rotation and translation, which have simple analytic forms for sinusoidal motions. The agreement and disagreement between the computed forces and experiments offer further insight into when the 3D effects are important.A main difference between a 3D revolving wing and a 2D translating wing is the absence of vortex shedding by a revolving wing over a distance much longer than the typical stroke length of insects. No doubt such a difference in shedding dynamics is responsible in part for the differences in steady state force coefficients measured in 2D and 3D. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such differences would have a significant effect on transient force coefficients before the onset of shedding. While the 2D steady state force coefficients underpredict 3D forces, the transient 2D forces measured prior to shedding are much closer to the 3D forces. In the cases studied here,the chord is moving between 3 to 5 chords, typical of hovering insect stroke length, and the flow does not appear to separate during each stroke in the cases of advanced and symmetrical rotation. In these cases, the wing reverses before the leading edge vortex would have time to separate even in 2D. This suggests that the time scale for flow separation in these strokes is dictated by the flapping frequency, which is dimensionally independent. In such cases,the 2D unsteady forces turn out to be good approximations of 3D experiments.},

  abstract = {Many flying animals use optic flow to control their flight. During landing maneuvers, pigeons, hummingbirds, bats, Draco lizards and bees use the -constant braking strategy. This strategy regulates the approach by keeping the ratio of distance to an object and the rate of change of that distance constant. In keeping this ratio, , constant, a variety of deceleration profiles can lead to different collision avoidance behaviors. The landing behaviors listed above all qualify as controlled collisions, where the animal is decelerating into the object. We examined whether the same regulatory strategy is employed by mallards when landing on water. Video of mallard landing behavior was recorded at a local pond and digitized. Kinematic and {$\tau$} parameters were calculated for each landing (N=177). The Pearson correlation coefficient for {$\tau$} with respect to time to land was 0.99\textpm 0.02, indicating mallards employ a controlled-collision strategy. This result implies regulation by the birds to fix  as constant while landing (on average, 0.90\textpm 0.13). In comparison with other active flyers, mallards use a higher value of  when landing (0.775\textpm 0.109, 0.710\textpm 0.132 and 0.702\textpm 0.052 for pigeons, hummingbirds and bats, respectively). This higher  may reflect physical differences in substrate from solid to liquid. The higher compliance of water in comparison to a solid substrate may reduce impact forces that could be injurious on a solid substrate, thereby enabling mallards to approach faster and expend less energy for costly, slow flight.},

  abstract = {Avian perching maneuvers are one of the most frequent and agile flight scenarios, where highly optimized flight trajectories, produced by rapid wing and tail morphing that generate high angular rates and accelerations, reduce kinetic energy at impact. While the behavioral, anatomical, and aerodynamic factors involved in these maneuvers are well described, the underlying control strategies are poorly understood. Here, we use optimal control methods on an avian-inspired drone with morphing wing and tail to test a recent hypothesis derived from perching maneuver experiments of Harris' hawks that birds minimize the distance flown at high angles of attack to dissipate kinetic energy before impact. The resulting drone flight trajectories, morphing sequence, and kinetic energy distribution resemble those measured in birds. Furthermore, experimental manipulation of the wings that would be difficult or unethical with animals reveals the morphing factors that are critical for optimal perching maneuver performance of birds and morphing-wing drones.},

  abstract = {When flying snakes glide, they use aerial undulation. To determine if aerial undulation is a flight control strategy or a non-functional behavioural vestige of lateral undulation, we measured snake glides using high-speed motion capture and developed a new dynamical model of gliding. Reconstructions of the snake's wing-body reveal that aerial undulation is composed of horizontal and vertical waves, whose phases differ by 90{$^\circ$} and whose frequencies differ by a factor of two. Using these results, we developed a three-dimensional mathematical model of snake flight that incorporates aerodynamic and inertial effects. Although simulated glides without undulation attained some horizontal distance, they are biologically unrealistic because they failed due to roll and pitch instabilities. In contrast, the inclusion of undulation stabilized the rotational motion and markedly increased glide performance. This work demonstrates that aerial undulation in snakes serves a different function than known uses of undulation in other animals, and suggests a new template of control for dynamic flying robots.},

  abstract = {Flapping wings produce lift and thrust in bio-inspired aerial robots, leading to quiet, safe and efficient flight. However, to extend their application scope, these robots must perch and land, a feat widely demonstrated by birds. Despite recent progress, flapping-wing vehicles, or ornithopters, are to this day unable to stop their flight. In this paper, we present a process to autonomously land an ornithopter on a branch. This method describes the joint operation of a pitch-yaw-altitude flapping flight controller, an optical close-range correction system and a bistable claw appendage design that can grasp a branch within 25 milliseconds and re-open. We validate this method with a 700\,g robot and demonstrate the first autonomous perching flight of a flapping-wing robot on a branch, a result replicated with a second robot. This work paves the way towards the application of flapping-wing robots for long-range missions, bird observation, manipulation, and outdoor flight.},
